# Blueprint: FadeClub - Modern Barber Booking App

This document outlines the complete plan for creating the FadeClub application. It includes details on project structure, components, data flow, and a step-by-step implementation guide.

*(Version 4.1: 5-Step Flow with Enhanced UI - UPDATED)*

**Recent Improvements (v4.1):**
- âœ… Professional FadeClub logo integration with responsive design
- âœ… Animated barber pole progress bar with traditional red, white, and blue stripes
- âœ… Enhanced visual feedback and smooth transitions throughout booking flow

## 1. Project Overview

FadeClub is a modern, single-page web application designed to provide a seamless online booking experience for a barber's clients. The admin side features a simple, visual dashboard for managing appointments.

- **Client Flow (v4.1):** A 5-step process with enhanced visual feedback. First, clients choose between one-time services or monthly memberships. Then they select specific services, choose preferred appointment times, fill out an intake form, and receive confirmation. Form submissions with time preferences are emailed to the admin for manual scheduling confirmation. Progress is shown through an animated barber pole progress bar.
- **Admin Flow:** A visual daily/weekly schedule with the ability to view client submissions (leads).
- **Core Principles:** Simplicity, clarity, modern aesthetic, and professional branding.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Emailing:** Resend (configured with real email delivery)
- **Data Storage:** A local `bookings.json` file acts as the database for client leads.

## 3. Project Structure

(No changes to the file structure)

## 4. Data and Type Definitions

File: `lib/types.ts` âœ… **COMPLETED**

Updated to support both one-time services and monthly subscriptions with separate interfaces:

```typescript
// lib/types.ts

export interface OneTimeService {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  duration: number; // Duration in minutes (standardized to 60)
  type: 'one-time';
}

export interface MonthlyService {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number; // Monthly price
  duration: number; // Typical appointment duration
  type: 'monthly';
}

export type Service = OneTimeService | MonthlyService;

export interface Booking {
  id: string; // Unique ID for the submission
  service: Service;
  client: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    phone: string;
    isFirstTime: boolean;
    notes: string;
  };
  preferredTimes?: {
    date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD format
    time: string; // HH:MM format
    displayDate: string; // e.g., "Mon, Jan 15"
    displayTime: string; // e.g., "10:00 AM"
  }[]; // Client's preferred appointment times (up to 3)
  submissionDate: Date; // When the user submitted the form
  dateTime?: Date; // Optional: To be set by the admin later
}
```
